"The Book of the Dead": ...Spirts who are trapped need Guidance.
TO GUIDE SPIRITS USE SIMPLE TERMS LIKE:

Move _

/."Move"
SPIRITS USE THE CARDINAL SYSTEM FOR DIRECTION
For Example:

/."Pickup" & "Drop"
TRY NOT TO CONFUSE SPIRITS AND TO BE PRECISE

Pickup skull

LASTLY, IF THE SPIRIT WAS HUMAN, USE:

/."Think!"
DON'T FORGET THE EXCLIMATION MARK !!!!
