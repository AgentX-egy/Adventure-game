Rumors say an engineering student fell asleep in the underground workshop one day, searching for wealth
					CHAPTER 0 - Prolog
At night, you -a night guard- saw a boy through the security cameras.
It's 2:00 AM.
The entire campus closes automatically. It doesn't opened until morning, only the dean can open it.
You tried to wake the boy up using security controls, but nothing works. 
You tried pressing buttons: the speaker, the lights, the gates. Nothing works.

The underground level had not been maintained for ages.
"Why would anybody be down there anyway," you asked.

A few minutes later the boy woke up on their own.
You saw that the first thing the boy did was to check their phone.
"He is using an EngineeringTemp™ phone," you noticed "I can contact him using it."

>>"Hello."
> "hi...."
> "who are u?"
>>"I'm a security guard."
>>"It's 2 AM, how are you done there?
> "i had a class and i think! i overslept 😆
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*sigh*
"Wait a minute!?!" you thought.
"There are no classes in the underground workshops. Not anymore."
As you tried to contact him again to clear his misconception or possibly his lie. A message pops on your monitor....
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> "Can you guide me out of here?"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You feel like you have read something similar before.
You feel like read that phrase haunted you from ages ago, and it came.
It came back to haunt you 
You tremble. However, you tried to ignore the thoughts and to continue typing.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>"Why are you down there? There have not been any classes in the underground workshops for thirteen years."
> "...."
> "Can you guide me out of here?"
> "Can you guide me out of here?"
> "Can you guide me out of here?"
> "Can you guide me out of here?"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The power went out.
The computer shutdown.
The light is off and its dark.
Freaked out, you try to stay calm.
*Heavy Breathing*
*Rapid Breathing*
*Slow Breathing*
Calm, at last, you jumped at the lights switching back on.
The computer switched on again.
But the kid was gone.
					CHAPTER 1
For an entire week, you saw the kid; but never did you even think of contacting him again.
At night he wakes up, roam around as if lost. And in the morning, he simply vanishes.
You tried to access the underground workshops at day, but the doors don't respond.
Finally, you had to ask someone, "I need some help" you thought.
So, you asked the internet - the best of the best.
"The Book of the Dead" is what you found.
