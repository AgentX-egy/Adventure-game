"Only one page is this useful," you thought "imagine if I had the whole book!"

From the internet, you only found this one page as a preview, for the entire book you have to pay for it: $3000.

The boy vanishes for the night. As he always does.

Back home, and to bed, however, hours pass with no sleep.

You get up and roam aimlessly around the house. Like a ghost.

"That kid, he sure looks like Fobi."

In the middle of the room, you close your eyes and clear your mind, trying to focus on all of what happened this week.

"Ok" you sigh. 

"Fobi..." 
you tense at the thought of your best friend back in college.

Four years ago, Fobi was in search of his family heirloom. 
Or so he says.

Till this day he never returned, the last time you saw him he asked for your help in the quest, but -mockingly- you turn him down.

"Do you really buy in this folklore? it is nonsense." you teased Fobi.

Fobi is really sad, you can't blame 'em.
"You know," Fobi said "I spent my entire childhood dreaming of this adventure where I return my family treasure back home.
Since childhood, I worked hard to get here..."

Here, implying, the top college in the entire country. You can call any student "Here" a genius, and you wouldn't be wrong.

For whatever reason he is gone, you feel a bit responsible.
Fobi was searching ever since he got accepted, and yet when he talked with you last, he disappeared.
					Chapter 2
The next night in the office the kid is back. Everything is the same as last night. Nothing changed to your relief.

The phantom boy took a while, but finally answered "yes"
